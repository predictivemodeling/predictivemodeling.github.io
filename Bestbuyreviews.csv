Jan 24 2020 4:18 PM,5,Sleek look and easy to fit it on my nightstand with my phone charger.
Jan 24 2020 4:06 PM,5,I love my Google Mini she actually loves when I ask her to do something because I always say please it's so cute!!
Jan 24 2020 4:02 PM,4,It's a great place to start to learn about modern electronics.
Jan 24 2020 3:57 PM,4,I am enjoying it big time i love it very nice funny
Jan 24 2020 3:56 PM,5,This is a great product to start with if you are a beginner and/or starting to make your home a smart home.
Jan 24 2020 3:54 PM,5,Very Happy with the service and help I got at Best Buy.
Jan 24 2020 3:46 PM,5,"Simply smart
Plug and play and you will find you use it more and more with time."
Jan 24 2020 3:08 PM,5,I have enjoies my google home and it works well with google.  It is a little tricky to set up with 3rd party apps but eventually you will get them to work
Jan 24 2020 9:10 AM,5,Very nice and small maybe the sound from the Amazon echo 3 is powerful but you can say its about the same performing
Jan 24 2020 1:51 AM,5,I use these in nearly every room of the house to supplement and expand coverage for my Nest Hub. Great audio range and small enough to tuck away out of sight.
Jan 23 2020 12:37 PM,5,Bought this as a present for my kids and they love it. Makes the tech in their room even more accessible and more efficient.
Jan 23 2020 11:56 AM,5,We have a couple of these and we love both of them. We have attached some of our lights to them so we can turn them off and on with our voice which is pretty cool
Jan 23 2020 1:16 AM,4,The speaker doesn’t have the beat quality but I keep it at my bedside and use it to control my TV. For the price I paid It was well worth it.
Jan 22 2020 11:57 PM,5,We all know what the Google home is by now. I haven't tried the 2nd gen but this first one does everything I need it to do pretty well. Surprisingly it even plays music with decent quality. If you have a smart home or are just starting out you can't go wrong with a mini!
Jan 22 2020 5:17 PM,4,I ranked 4 stars because I have an Alexa and bought this for a friend and we did some tests and we notice that the Home Mini is supported in less products than Alexa also that some times Home Mini will not understand you and you will be almost shouting but it will do the basic stuff for the price.
Jan 22 2020 6:13 AM,5,Easy to set up and easy to use. Solid construction and doesn't take up much space. The sound is better than I expected. I use it multiple times a day.
Jan 21 2020 8:23 PM,5,Easy to use great assistant. And I absolutely love playing music on it!
Jan 21 2020 6:28 PM,5,This is a great Product for remembering to take medication and not forgetting your lunch!  easy to set up and use!
Jan 21 2020 11:33 AM,5,"I purchased this item for my Motherwho loves to listen to her old times favorites (Frank SinatraNat King Coleetc.) not knowing if she could even turn it on/off by saying ""hey google"". She absolutely loves it and asks more and more of google everyday-very happy I bought it for her!!"
Jan 21 2020 10:42 AM,4,"From out of the box I had the mini set up in minutes
Excellent purchase"
Jan 19 2020 5:09 PM,5,Really nice little guy that does the job well. Only complaint is now I don't have to ever get out of bed to do anything! Also bought the smart light bulbs to go with it.
Jan 19 2020 11:21 AM,4,Really easy to use and is pretty good at understanding commands.
Jan 19 2020 7:41 AM,4,This thing is great for the office or kids........
Jan 18 2020 9:47 PM,5,You can carry on a conversation as well as listen to music and etc.
Jan 18 2020 9:39 PM,5,I really like those minis. They work well and don't take too much space and they sound great. Got this one on black friday for cheap.
Jan 18 2020 9:36 PM,5,I could not pass up getting another Google home mini to use around the house. It comes in handy too with our added smart bulbs and switch we just installed.
Jan 18 2020 9:21 PM,5,Nice Add on for my new smart thermostat.  Now I can change the temperature setting without even getting out of my chair :-)
Jan 18 2020 4:34 PM,5,My fiend seems to love it needed to get him going with the Google Home.
Jan 18 2020 4:28 PM,5,Use it every morning and throughout the day. A great little assistant!
Jan 18 2020 12:24 PM,5,Excellent product love it! Bought a second one for the bedroom.
Jan 18 2020 11:11 AM,4,First of all I love the coral color of my Google-Home mini! Secondly  I love the features (alarms reminders music weather etc). I would recommend this product to friends and family; it keeps me organized.
Jan 18 2020 10:35 AM,5,"We are enjoying the features of the Google Mini.
It was a little tricky setting up the Smart lights. 
We finally followed a U-Tube video to get them set up."
Jan 18 2020 10:15 AM,4,My daughter she love it. It's great and easy to use it.
Jan 18 2020 9:51 AM,5,Have paired this Google Home Mini with a second Home Mini to output stereo audio from my Desktop PC. Linking to PC via Bluetooth.
Jan 18 2020 9:42 AM,5,Once you get used to it being there it comes in handy
Jan 18 2020 9:26 AM,5,Great item!  It's the best arguement settler in the house!
Jan 18 2020 9:09 AM,5,The speaker is as good as any Bluetooth one of similar size but those don’t search for tunes on the internet adjust the lights change channels on the tv tell you if you’ll need an umbrella today translate a conversation between you and your new Italian friend while standing in the kitchen or talk down a recipe for a new dish you wanna try.
Jan 18 2020 8:04 AM,5,Easy for preteens to utilize and connect to favorite music interfaces
Jan 18 2020 8:01 AM,5,The Google home mini is a great item to compare to the Amazon Alexa. It is very easy to install and use. The sound is good playing your music and connects easily to you Bluetooth device. If you have younger kids they will love the jokes and game that are played on it.
Jan 18 2020 7:45 AM,5,My son loves it in his room was a great stocking stuffer.
Jun 26 2020 10:22 PM,5,Simple to use you can place anywhere I like how it sounds as well
Jun 26 2020 7:48 PM,5,I didn’t think I would use this as much as I do.  Can’t go thru my day without it
Jun 26 2020 7:09 PM,5,Hey Google! Thanks for helping me answer my questions and wake up in the morning.
Jun 26 2020 6:54 PM,5,Love that my Google gives me all the info I need. You can ask for the weather listen to music or even broadcast a message to another Google device in the same home.
Jun 26 2020 6:50 PM,5,Works so much better than the Alexas. Less word sensitive. Gave mine an Australian accent.
Jun 26 2020 6:03 PM,5,Great for bedrooms. Kids both have one. They love it
Jun 26 2020 4:56 PM,5,Put this on the 3rd floor so I don't have to walk upstairs to reach my children. Speaker sounds great! Don't call me lazy just love my tech!
Jun 26 2020 4:52 PM,4,I got this as gift and really enjoyed so bought another for my different room.
Jun 26 2020 4:41 PM,4,sometimes it disconnects but our internet is wonky. Love it though
Jun 26 2020 4:26 PM,4,It’s a good speaker for only bring in one area not for moving if I connect my phone through Bluetooth mid way through the music or song I’m listening to it disconnects from the speaker play 2 sons and disconnects again.
Jun 26 2020 4:24 PM,4,Bought this for my son for Christmas. The only downfall is it does not seem to separate voices as it says.

Jun 26 2020 4:20 PM,5,This has completely changed the way my room operates!
Jun 26 2020 4:19 PM,5,I got this as a gift for my nephew and he is loving it!
Jun 26 2020 3:52 PM,5,I have 4 of these set up in each room.  I love how I can play music and hear it in all my rooms.  I would recommend these Smart Speakers.
Jun 26 2020 3:42 PM,5,I really like the original Google home because for 25 dollars a piece I can put Google assistant in every room in my house. And they have pretty decent sound quality which is a plus.
Jun 26 2020 7:51 AM,5,I have one for each room in the house. Not only do I find them essential now. But still fun to screw with family members staying in the “scary” room by turning the lights off and on from phone when I am not even home....LOL
Jun 25 2020 4:06 AM,5,Google home mini is easy to install and a great addition to the home
Jun 24 2020 9:27 PM,3,But I really don't use it don't want to give google access to our conversations...
Jun 24 2020 3:02 PM,5,I've owned this product for quite some time and it has held up really good. The amount of features this thing has are interesting to explore. If you don't have a steady wifi connection or at all you can still pair this up as a bluetooth speaker and just play audio from your phone or any other capable device.
